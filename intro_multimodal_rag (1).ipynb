    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become a popular paradigm for enabling LLMs to access external data and also as a mechanism for grounding to mitigate against hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to perform multimodal RAG where you will perform Q&A over a financial document filled with both text and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision and Gemini 1.0 Pro models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing text-based and multimodal RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal RAG offers several advantages over text-based RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced knowledge access:** Multimodal RAG can access and process both textual and visual information, providing a richer and more comprehensive knowledge base for the LLM.\n",
    "2. **Improved reasoning capabilities:** By incorporating visual cues, multimodal RAG can make better informed inferences across different types of data modalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to use RAG with Vertex AI Gemini API, [text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/text-embeddings), and [multimodal embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/multimodal-embeddings), to build a document search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hands-on examples, you will discover how to construct a multimedia-rich metadata repository of your document sources, enabling search, comparison, and reasoning across diverse information streams."
